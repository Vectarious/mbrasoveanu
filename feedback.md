Your `gravitation` script does run and produce the correct results for height, but it is still missing
1. comments about the questions posed in Problem 2.
1. the functionality of taking `T` from the command line - please look at the function `input`
1. the correct velocity calculation
Now, you should look at line 10 and ask yourself how this affects the calculation at line 12, do you see a problem. On another note, try using `table(v',h')` instead of `table(v,h)` on line 15.

Problem 2's modifications are noted, and they look good. The only thing that is left is to get the velocity calculation correct. The problem starts on line 17 in `gravitationinput.m`
I can't run problem 3, did you forget to include something?
