Your `gravitation` script does run and produce the correct results for height, but it is still missing
1. comments about the questions posed in Problem 2.
1. the functionality of taking `T` from the command line - please look at the function `input`
1. the correct velocity calculation
Now, you should look at line 10 and ask yourself how this affects the calculation at line 12, do you see a problem. On another note, try using `table(v',h')` instead of `table(v,h)` on line 15.

Problem 2's modifications are noted, and they look good. The only thing that is left is to get the velocity calculation correct. The problem starts on line 17 in `gravitationinput.m`
I can't run problem 3, did you forget to include something?
I just added the table for problem 3 onto my repository, the program should be able to run now.

Program 3 runs now, but you have to take the lesson you should have learned in problem 3 and apply it to problem 4 - because I cannot run any of those programs. What's missing?

For problems 4,4a,4b, I added "smallperiodtable.mat", "GlobalTempybyYear.txt", and "GlobalCarbonBudget2018.xlsx" files. The following programs should be able to run now.

Problem 3 and 4 are running now. Problem 4a/climate program are hitting some problems still - there are minor mistakes in that code, double check that the file you're referencing is the same as the one in the folder (spelled the same way and everything). Minor details, but details are everything.

For Problem 4a I have added the 'smallperiodictable.csv' file that should allow the program to work entirely. In addition, I have completely updated problem 4b with its corresponding files.
