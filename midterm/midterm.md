I think that you overthought this midterm. I tried to encourage everyone to stay away from SI units. I also don't understand why you were calculating 1) the mass of the planet (that was supposed to be an input), 2) the radius of the planet (another input), and 3) the altitude (of what???). All you really needed was line 44 and 48 in your function. In the second part, you were just able to read the file.
